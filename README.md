# bench-matrix

bench-matrix benchmarks every commit that lands on the `main` branch of
[smolquery/smolquery](https://github.com/smolquery/smolquery). Each run
commits its results to this repository, so the history stays in git.

## What runs

A run starts the smolquery image for one commit and runs two benches on the
[ClickBench](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench) `hits` dataset.

| bench | what it does | what it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **load** | Creates `bench.hits` (105 columns), inserts 10M rows through the NDJSON insert route, then waits until the hot tier seals to object storage. | Ingest time and rows/s until the last insert is acknowledged. Seal time until the hot tier is empty. An exact `count(*)` check. The bench fails if the count is wrong or the seal does not finish in 20 minutes. |
| **query** | Runs the 43 ClickBench queries, 3 tries each, through `POST /v1/queries`. | The first try and the best of the other two tries ("hot"), per query. The sums and the geometric mean of the hot times. |

The stack is one smolquery node, configured like a production node:

- **Catalog:** Postgres 17 (`SMOLQUERY_CATALOG`).
- **Sealed tier:** [RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs), an S3-compatible
  object store (`SMOLQUERY_S3_*`).
- **Query file cache:** on (`SMOLQUERY_QUERY_FILE_CACHE_DIR`).
- **Memory:** a 12 GB container limit (`SMOLQUERY_MEM_LIMIT`). smolquery sizes
  its storage engines from the cgroup limit, as it does in a Kubernetes pod.
- **Job memory:** `SMOLQUERY_JOB_MEMORY_LIMIT=6GB`.

`compose.yaml` holds the full configuration.

The load bench converts Parquet to NDJSON with the DuckDB CLI on the same
machine. That conversion shares the CPU with smolquery during the load.

## When it runs

- **On each push to smolquery `main`.** The smolquery `release.yml` workflow
  sends a `repository_dispatch` (`smolquery-main`) with the commit SHA after it
  pushes the image `ghcr.io/chasers/smolquery:sha-<sha>`.
- **Manually.** Run the `Bench` workflow with an optional `sha` input.
- **Daily at 06:17 UTC.** The run benches the `main` head if no run for that
  commit exists. This catches a lost dispatch.

Runs queue one at a time. The runner is a GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` machine
(4 vCPU, 16 GB). Shared runners add noise, so compare trends, not single runs.

## Where the results are

- `results/history.jsonl`: one summary line per run, append-only.
- `results/runs/<timestamp>_<sha>/`: `meta.json`, `load.json` and
  `query.json` for one run.
- The section below: the latest run, the last 30 runs, and per-query times
  against the previous run. `bench publish` rewrites it after each run.
- Each workflow run also uploads `out/` with the container logs as an artifact.

## Run it locally

You need Docker, Go 1.26, `curl` and `unzip`.

1. Pick an image: `export SMOLQUERY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/chasers/smolquery:sha-<full sha>`.
2. Run the benches: `FILES=10 scripts/run.sh`. The results go to `out/`.
3. Stop the stack: `scripts/down.sh`.

`FILES` sets the number of 1M-row parquet files (default 10). If ports 4000 or
9000 are in use, set `SMOLQUERY_PORT` and `RUSTFS_PORT`.

## Layout

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `cmd/bench` | The Go harness: `bench load`, `bench query`, `bench publish`. |
| `suites/clickbench` | The table definition with its clustering key, and the 43 queries. |
| `scripts` | `fetch.sh` (data and DuckDB CLI), `up.sh`, `down.sh`, `run.sh`. |
| `compose.yaml` | Postgres, RustFS and smolquery. |
| `.github/workflows/bench.yml` | The CI workflow. |
